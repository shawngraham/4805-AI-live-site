## A full year seminar at Carleton U, 2024-25

- Open to History students, Digital Humanities Minors, and others with permission.
- We will explore the history of artificial intelligence, and try to figure out what current AI techs can do, ethically, in terms of historical research.
- The first term will be seminar-driven explorations of key moments, literature, and technologies.
- The second term will involve you designing, implementing, and evaluating an application of ai technologies to historical or pedagogical ends.
- As a class, we will also produce an open-source Handbook to History and AI.
